Who surrounds himself with people of different minds so he can weigh ideas and be challenged and respected instead of being coddled and feared. Instead of invading under the ridiculous ""cover"" of helping, he offers to hold a rather ordinary conference with all parties in, say, Paris, in the interest of understanding instead of name-calling. In the interest of sincerely helping, instead of sending imposters down with weapons and questions that remind the oldest pensioners of something worse than the disorganized and often negligent Ukrainian government: Stalin's Five-Year Plan that caused the famine, the death of millions of Ukrainians.<br/>Imagine this leader, who has never been KGB and for whom the cold war is truly OVER.

One is imported whereas the other is indigenous, country-made.
